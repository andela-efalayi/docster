- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [React-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)
- [React-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)

***
#### Getting Started
- Clone the project from repository [github.com/andela-efalayi/asedeyhot-news](https://github.com/andela-efalayi/docster)
- In your terminal, cd into the cloned folder and run `npm install`. This installs all the app's dependencies.
- Run `npm start` in your terminal, open your browser, and type `localhost:2700`. This runs the application on your local machine.
- Alternatively, you can access the app on [docster-dms.herokuapp.com](https://docster-dms.herokuapp.com/)

##### NPM Scripts
To make development easier, some NPM scripts were written:
- `npm run reset:db` undos all database migrations
- `npm run seed:all` migrates database tables and seeds data
- `npm run fill:db` chains two scripts: `npm run reset:db` and `npm run seed:all`
- `npm run mocha` runs mocha test for server
- `npm run server-test` chains two scripts: `npm run fill:db` and `npm run mocha`

##### Running Tests
Application view components and routes were tested using Jest, Mocha, and Chai. To tun the tests:
- cd into the cloned Docster folder
- Run `npm run server-test` in terminal. This runs the server test
*NOTE*: It is advised that you have a different database for running your tests.
